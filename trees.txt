
Just planting and growing more trees in empty landscapes or just where it’s possible, 
could be a solution where it could save the future from losing a large amount of trees. 
There might also be a possibility to not make up for the lost amount of trees too because 
its taking way too long for them to grow up and people may still be chopping them down. 
For now, we just have to focus on growing up more trees.


For the sake of the photosynthesis, we have to stop people from cutting down trees/forests. 
The trees are a huge factor in our fight for decreasing the amount of pollution in the air 
so we can’t chop them down. We may need wood for some things in our daily life, but we have 
to at least minimize the number of trees being cut down by a lot. While doing that, 
we might make many people unemployed. That’s why we should focus on finding a lot of replacement jobs too.


There’s no need to use a lot of paper these days because now we have the technology to 
store all kinds of information in our phones and computers. 
This way makes it possible to not waste a lot of trees like we did before.
